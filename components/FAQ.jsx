                    What is QiGong?
                </summary>

                <span>
                Qi Gong is breath. The discipline of Qi Gong teaches how to breathe, to cleanse and detoxify the body. It is the key for maintaining health and to recover quickly from sickness. You can live without food and water for many days, but only 5 minutes without breathing. That's why Qi Gong is more important than knowing how many vitamins to take...
                The Daoists observed nature and the communication between breathing and the Universe, how through breathing we can receive help from nature through the plants, the Earth, the Sun... It is a proven fact that turtles live the longest of any creature on Earth. The Daoists observed the way turtles breathe, and they taught how to imitate their breathing to achieve longevity.
                Qi Gong studies three kinds of breathing: the breathing you are all familiar with, through your nose and mouth, as well as abdominal breathing and breathing through every pore of the skin. From the macro point of view, you breathe in and out through your nose and mouth, but from the micro point of view, you breathe in and out with the universe. Observe nature on a smaller and smaller scale, go smaller than the atom, and you still find an exchange of breath going on. Without breath, there is no life.
                Birth and death are processes of Qi, or breathing. Qi is created by any interaction with and by any adjustment to the universe all around you. We wear more clothes when it gets cold, we drink when thirsty, we sleep when tired... we need to adjust to any and all changes in the natural world in order to survive. Knowledge of Qi Gong makes you able to adjust also to those aspects of nature, which are not so easy to observe. This ability to adjust promotes longevity.
                Qi Gong is everywhere and you cannot get away from it. When you practice any religion - as you worship, kneel down, join hands in prayer... that is breathing... when you communicate with another being... that is breathing... when a bird sings to you... when you are in love... that is breathing. That is Qi Gong.

                I teach practices to bring the Qi through your body's meridians, so that you can cure yourself of your sickness or imbalance. Your own practice can enhance and speed up any medical treatment, but you don't need to practice by yourself in order to receive the benefits of medical Qi Gong. As a Qi Gong doctor, I can help you to heal yourself; I can give you a hand to help your body get rid of sickness.

                That is already happening. I work with American doctors from the Santa Monica Hospital, among others, and I see a lot of cancer patients who are also receiving Western medical care. I envision a future when Qi Gong will play a major role in Western medicine.

                Yes. I treat and balance all the Qi in your body, which, besides treating the physical illness, positively balances and affects your emotional, mental and spiritual life, so you blend with the Qi of the Universe and become harmonious with the Universal flow. It is then that you receive unlimited abundance.

                There are more people now in Los Angeles teaching and practicing Qi Gong. What should one be aware of when choosing a Qi Gong teacher or practitioner?
                </summary>

                <span>
                Qi Gong belongs to China's ancient culture, but not many have studied it. The Daoists did. Qi Gong originated with Daoism 5000 years ago, and the White Cloud Monastery, where Daoist thinking and its origins have been preserved, has been the leader in Qi Gong training throughout its 1000 year long history. Harvard, Yale, or other top Western universities cannot claim such a historical leadership in any field. There are not many advanced Qi Gong Masters from the White Cloud Monastery, and beside myself they all now live in China, though this may change.

                One should be aware that in this field many practitioners are not authentic and have not studied Qi Gong in any depth. Find out whether the teacher you are considering is licensed, and whether he is a doctor, since only doctors can teach Qi Gong. Have in mind that a Chinese medical doctor trained in Mainland China has a different kind of medical training than that of doctors trained here. These are documented facts that can be checked on.

                Between the hours of 7 and 9 either in the a.m. or p.m. stand in a comfortable position with your feet shoulder width apart. You may be indoors or outdoors. Close your eyes. Imagine drawing your eyes down to the soles of your feet, and with your awareness there, breathe evenly and slowly for five minutes. This technique will improve your eyesight, increase your memory, lower blood pressure and alleviate insomnia. Remember, an important part of Qi Gong is not to go to extremes. Do everything with moderation. Eat to half full, nothing too hot or spicy. Avoid excessive feelings, even excitement. Keep your feet warm. Keep your head cool. These are basic requirements of Qi Gong.

                Once I determine what is wrong, I remove the bad energy in order to make space for the good energy. Then, depending on what is needed, I collect Qi from nature - from trees, flowers, or the Sun, and then I transmit the good Qi into the patient, from a point in the palm of my hand. Qi Gong treatment is like getting a blood transfusion... but it is easy, effective, and it does not cost as much. It is a completely safe and natural form of treatment, with no side effects whatsoever.

                It can help everything. It helps all the systems of your body. It strengthens the nervous system and the immune system. The immune system knows what it needs to do to fight off diseases. It just needs the power to do it. Qi Gong gives it back its power. I have treated diabetics by changing their diet and teaching them how to breathe. Their blood sugar drops tremendously. Qi Gong helps the elderly with back and leg pains. Qi Gong treatments help with headaches and high blood pressure.

                Both forms of treatment use the same meridians and points in the body, but with Qi Gong I am putting pure Qi that I have gathered from nature into the point, instead of using a needle like in acupuncture. Acupuncture is appropriate and effective in certain illnesses, but Qi Gong can cure a broader spectrum of diseases.

                What are the benefits of learning to practice Qi Gong?
                </summary>

                <span class="px-4 py-2">
                Practicing Qi Gong helps you to achieve longevity. By detecting any sickness at a very early stage, before it is observable by Western science, you can then heal it faster. You learn to manage stress better, to achieve calm and peace. It gives you a new point of view, enhancing your communication with others, and it helps you in your career and studies. You learn to resolve your own suffering and your own sickness by yourself. Through consistent practice for over six months, these are some of the goals that can be reached:

                It strengthens the central nervous system for a quick improvement of your memory.
                It enhances the immune system in order to prevent cancer, heart and cerebral diseases. It restores your energy and is effective on weakness, allergies, all kinds of pains and other immune system diseases.
                It adjusts all of your internal systems to help digestion. Practicing Qi Gong has another benefit as well. You release good Qi for others, for the trees, for all of nature, so that you help bring balance to the world. Like the breath, which Qi Gong is, there is a mutual exchange, which benefits all of life.
